# Website undergoing improvements

Lots of changes here!

The front page now displays the most recent blog post, so if you don't feel like heading over to the [blog](/blog/) then you don't have to! Also, the website has switched from .html files to .php files. The blog already was a .php file, but I felt like having some of each was just a terrible idea; it needs to be equal!

Alright, that's all for now. More updates soon!
