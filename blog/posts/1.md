# Website and Blog Active

Hello, all.

The Maryland Mesh website and blog are now active, though not yet finished. It is hosted on our server, Vegasix, in Harford County. The source is available on GitHub, for both the [site itself](https://github.com/marylandmesh/homepage) and the [blog](https://github.com/marylandmesh/blog). We are in the process of arranging a Nodeshot instance and mailing list.

Everything is still in development, but this may be a bright start. Please report bugs and requests to the [issue page](https://github.com/marylandmesh/homepage/issues).
