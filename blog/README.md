#Blog

To write a blog post, follow these guidelines:

At the top of your post, include the day, time, and author name. For example:
```
Friday, January 18, 2013
11:13 AM
Luke Evers
```
Then the rest of the post is written in markdown. It's preferred that the subject line is your next line. Here's an example post:
```
Friday, January 18, 2013
11:15 AM
Luke Evers

#This is the subject

This is the body, where we can put pretty much anything we want! 
```
Also, remember to name each file sequentially and have the extension `.md`.
